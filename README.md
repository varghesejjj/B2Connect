# B2Connect

This is a simple web app built using the MERN stack.

The application has features of Creating a user, Graphical view of exchange rate of currencies and to check the location information using the IP address.
It uses Chart.js to plot the graphs. The exchange rates are recieved using the Exchangerate.host API.
The users IP location and information is recieved using geolocation-db.com
Additionally the users can get details about any IPv4 address. I have used iplocation.net api to achieve the functionality.
